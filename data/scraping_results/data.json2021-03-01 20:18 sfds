Monolith vs microservices is an ongoing debate. We are working to find a good authentication pattern that allows for people to work across companies in multiple roles (which is trickier than you might think). Domain Driven Design is our guiding light.\nAs a Staff Data Scientist, you will focus on aggregating and analyzing large datasets to identify behavior trends using statistics, advanced data mining techniques, and build data models to tackle real-world problems. This means helping to develop our training data, building quick prototypes to evaluate signal to noise ratio in the data, and piping them through multiple machine learning models to find the model that can help automate work. The ideal candidate is someone comfortable leading a team through greenfield projects while pouring over heaps of data to find patterns and train machines to do so with high accuracy and recall. You will build models from the ground up while updating existing models (ML and AI) to automate repetitive repeatable tasks. You will analyze data generated as a by-product of manual tasks and build models that can operate on similar or better accuracy than humans. Up for the challenge?\n\nOver the past 7+ years, you have mastered advanced machine learning techniques to experiment with large data sets while building models deployed in production. You have an expertise in one or more programming languages including Python, SQL or R and have used Cloud Platforms, bonus points for AWS. This is a niche role so advanced degrees in quantitative fields like Statistics, Computer Science, and Mathematics are required (PhDs are ideal).

Do you want to help scale up science to the world’s largest supercomputers? If so, consider joining NERSC as a HPC Performance (NESAP) Engineer.\nAs a NESAP engineer, you will be a part of a multidisciplinary team composed of computational and domain scientists working together to enable science that uses the capabilities of some of the largest supercomputers in the world.\nNERSC is a supercomputing center that supports 7000 scientists whose research is supported by the US Department of Energy. Soon NERSC will begin deploying a new GPU-accelerated supercomputer called “Perlmutter” featuring next-generation AMD Milan CPUs, NVIDIA Ampere A100 GPUs, a novel high-speed interconnect, and an all-flash file system. The NESAP program will enable new scientific advancements using Perlmutter by working with scientists to exploit cutting-edge computational science techniques. It has focus areas in machine learning, data analysis, and simulation.\nNESAP for Learning (N4L): focuses on developing and implementing cutting-edge machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) solutions to improve scientific discovery potential on experimental or simulation data or improving HPC applications by replacing parts of the software stack or algorithms with ML/DL solutions.\nNESAP for Data (N4D): addresses data-intensive science pipelines that process massive datasets from experimental and observational science (EOS) facilities like synchrotron light sources, telescopes, microscopes, particle accelerators, or genome sequencers. The goal is seamless integration and data flow between EOS facilities and supercomputing resources to enable scalable real-time data analytics.\nNESAP for Simulation (N4S): Cutting-edge simulation of complex physical phenomena requires increasing amounts of computational resources due to increasing model sizes, parameter space searches, and inclusion of additional physics for higher fidelity.
