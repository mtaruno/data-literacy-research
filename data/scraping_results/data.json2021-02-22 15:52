Whether they are conducting surveillance, identifying leads, interviewing subjects, testifying in court, tracking down money trails or advising on all matters related to our national security, their work entails far more than the typical 9 to 5. If those collective roles make up a career you wish to pursue, consider applying to the FBI.Our Special Agents seek out cyberthieves, infiltrate organized crime rings and oversee terrorism investigations, often training local, state and foreign counterparts on the latest technologies in intelligence gathering and data analysis. Of course, our ultimate mission is to protect the American people and uphold the Constitution of the United States.While individuals of all backgrounds are highly encouraged to apply to be an FBI Special Agent, we’re specifically seeking individuals with the following skills:SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, ENGINEERING AND MATH (STEM): Your STEM background could significantly contribute to our work in keeping up with evolving threats and aggressive actions taken against our national security. We need Special Agents who are logical thinkers and experienced in network security, computer science, software engineering, mathematical formulation and technology. Because technology permeates every aspect of what we do, counterterrorism investigations, as well as technology and computer-based cybercrimes (website hacks, intrusions, data theft, ransomware and other attacks) make up some of our top priorities.LINGUISTS: You may have been raised speaking a language other than English, taught it for a few years or even participated in intensive learning before going overseas to use it. You know that your language skills can make a difference, whether your specialty is Arabic, Bosnian, Chinese, Farsi, Russian, Spanish, Somali, Uzbek, Korean, Portuguese or another foreign language. Why not apply your knowledge of language and culture to a rewarding and sought-after career as an FBI linguist by translating written or audio materials, interpreting during a crucial interview of a subject or providing cultural expertise relating to any matter over which the FBI has jurisdiction?LAW/LEGAL: By applying your legal knowledge to our casework, you will be instrumental in helping investigate criminal activities and identifying authorities and other entities to further investigations.

Your teaching skills make you methodical and allow you to consolidate comprehensive information into strategic, analytical lesson plans. Your skills will easily translate to a Special Agent career, where you’ll enhance your team’s understanding of threats, vulnerabilities and gaps by investigating matters and building relationships with communities and individuals from all walks of life.CYBERSECURITY/TECHNOLOGY: Whether you work in counterterrorism, criminal investigations or preventing cyberattacks, investigating computer-based crimes (website hacks, intrusions, data theft, ransomware, etc.) make up some of our top priorities. You will work on highly collaborative investigative teams to stop counterintelligence plots, fraud, bank robberies and more.
