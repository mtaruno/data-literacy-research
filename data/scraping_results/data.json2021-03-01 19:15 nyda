The past two decades have seen important progress on child rights, yet while much has been achieved, sharp disparities remain. In most countries, inequality is higher today than a generation ago, including in middle income countries where most of the world’s poor children now live. The rapid pace of urbanization and the growing youth bulge in Africa and parts of Asia will require significant expansion of the provision of essential services for children. These challenges are compounded by the scale and complexity of crises triggered by conflict, natural disasters or epidemics. The global community faces these challenges when the political and economic environments pose challenges of their own, testing the world’s commitment to protecting the most vulnerable. In this environment, strong and consistent leadership of UNICEF is critical to enable the achievement of results for children.\n\nUNICEF USA (UUSA) is a private, independent, U.S. nonprofit that rallies the American public to support the world’s most vulnerable children through the unmatched reach of UNICEF.

The past two decades have seen important progress on child rights, yet while much has been achieved, sharp disparities remain. In most countries, inequality is higher today than a generation ago, including in middle income countries where most of the world’s poor children now live. The rapid pace of urbanization and the growing youth bulge in Africa and parts of Asia will require significant expansion of the provision of essential services for children. These challenges are compounded by the scale and complexity of crises triggered by conflict, natural disasters or epidemics. The global community faces these challenges when the political and economic environments pose challenges of their own, testing the world’s commitment to protecting the most vulnerable. In this environment, strong and consistent leadership of UNICEF is critical to enable the achievement of results for children.\n\nUNICEF USA (UUSA) is a private, independent, U.S. nonprofit that rallies the American public to support the world’s most vulnerable children through the unmatched reach of UNICEF.

The past two decades have seen important progress on child rights, yet while much has been achieved, sharp disparities remain. In most countries, inequality is higher today than a generation ago, including in middle income countries where most of the world’s poor children now live. The rapid pace of urbanization and the growing youth bulge in Africa and parts of Asia will require significant expansion of the provision of essential services for children. These challenges are compounded by the scale and complexity of crises triggered by conflict, natural disasters or epidemics. The global community faces these challenges when the political and economic environments pose challenges of their own, testing the world’s commitment to protecting the most vulnerable. In this environment, strong and consistent leadership of UNICEF is critical to enable the achievement of results for children.\n\nUNICEF USA (UUSA) is a private, independent, U.S. nonprofit that rallies the American public to support the world’s most vulnerable children through the unmatched reach of UNICEF. Headquartered in New York City, UUSA has some 300 employees distributed across nine regional offices in the U.S. To fuel UNICEF’s life-saving work across the globe, UUSA raises nearly $600 million dollars from private sources every year, and advocates for U.S. Government policies and funding to help children around the world.

This role involves high-touch data management to align technologies with business models and governance structures across global systems to drive data insight for UNICEF USA’s senior leadership as they prioritize key fundraising issues. While technical expertise is fundamental to the role, interfacing with client partner teams to resolve inquiries as well as develop solutions to UUSA’s prospect management infrastructure is key. They/he/she/ze must have strong aptitudes for analytical problem solving, relationship building, and agile project management to effectively collaborate across the organization and support an ambitious fundraising goal of more than $500 million annually.
