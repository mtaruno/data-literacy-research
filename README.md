# Data Literacy Research

In this research project, I collaborate with [Professor Sandra Cannon](https://www.sas.rochester.edu/dsc/people/faculty/cannon-sandra/index.html) in measuring data literacy expectations from the ways employers describe jobs and the way they describe the people they are looking for.
